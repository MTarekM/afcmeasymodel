This tool was developed as a part of Team AFCM-Egypt 2017 IGEM project, We have developed an interactive web tool that embeds R Codes used for modeling our project in a user-friendly interface. Solving ODEs could be quite challenging. However, it's crucial for modeling synthetic biology projects. We believe our software will help other iGEM teams working on ceRNA networks to solve ODEs easily, specify parameters, rates and reaction species. We believe this tool will help other teams model their projects in an easy interactive way without facing technical issues. You could modify parameters to be fitting your project. You may also save your plot as an image.
